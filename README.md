# Text summarizer Web App

Reading long articles or dialogues can be overwhelming, and finding the key points quickly isn’t always easy!

So I present my project, Text Summarizer Web App, an abstractive text summarizer built using Google’s PEGASUS Transformer model, fine-tuned on the SAMSum dataset.
It takes a large block of text as input through a simple web form and returns a concise, meaningful summary generated by my NLP model.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (3.13)

- Higging Face Transformers

- Jinja2, HTML, CSS (Template for UI)

- FastAPI (Web App)

- Azure App Service (Deployment)

- GitHub (CI/CD Integration)

## Usage:

1. User types or pastes a long text (article, paragraph, or conversation) into the input box.
2. Clicks the Summarize! button.
3. A new page reloads showing the concise summary generated by the NLP model.
4. Users can also send a POST request to the /predict API endpoint with raw text in JSON format to get the summary programmatically (e.g., via Postman or integration into other apps).

## How It Works:

The PEGASUS model (developed by Google) was fine-tuned on the SAMSum dataset, a dialogue summarization dataset containing thousands of conversations and their human-written summaries. PEGASUS is a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model designed specifically for abstractive summarization. Unlike extractive methods that simply pick sentences, PEGASUS generates new, concise sentences that capture the meaning of the text.

During training, the model was optimized using Hugging Face’s Transformers Trainer API, with ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) used to evaluate the quality of generated summaries. The trained model and tokenizer were then wrapped into a Prediction Pipeline, which handles preprocessing, text encoding, summary generation (using beam search and length penalties), and decoding into human-readable text.

The application backend is built with FastAPI. It exposes two interfaces:
- A UI route (/) where the user can paste text into a form and get the summary after clicking the Summarize button.
- An API route (/predict) that accepts JSON input and returns the generated summary, making it possible to test via Postman or integrate with other applications.

The frontend was designed using HTML and CSS, rendered via Jinja2 templates.

## For running on localhost:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/amaan-ali-1107/text-summarizer.git and navigate to the project folder using cd text-summarizer.

- Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv and activate it using     venv\Scripts\activate on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux.

- Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.

- Run the FastAPI application: python app.py.

- Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use the app locally.
